Taking part 5 is not mandatory.<br>

But if we want to take advantage of your 'Try out the Team & Governance plan features for 30 days' plan, we can set a Sentinel policy and a new Policy set to our forked 'tfc-guide-example' repository.<br>

#### Step 1 - Create a new Sentinel Policy and Policy Set

We connect to our Terraform Cloud UI, click on Settings, click on Policy Sets.<br>

Now we will add a new Sentinel Policy. Click on Policies.<br>

Create a new policy > call it 'tfc-guide-example-sentinel-policy'<br>

Description (not compulsory): 'First sentinel policy'.<br>

Enforcement mode: choose 'Soft-mandatory'<br>

Policy code: add the following line of code<br>

```r
main = rule {
	true
}
```
click on 'Create your first policy set' > connect to GitHub > Choose a repository: choose 'tfc-guide-example'

Scope of policies > select 'Policies enforced on selected workspaces'.<br>

In the Workspaces box, select 'tfc-guide-example' workspace, then 'Add workspace'.

Next: click on 'connect policy set'<br>

#### Update GitHub repository

Now that we have a new Sentinel policy and a Policy Set, we should add one file into our GitHub repository otherwise we'll get some error while queueing our plan.<br>

We go to 'tfc-guide-example' repository that we've forked.<br>

Click on 'Add file' > 'Create new file'

Call the file 'allowed-terraform-version.sentinel' and pass the following code onto it then click on 'Commit'<br>

```r
main = rule {
	true
}
```
Our newly created file should look like this:

<hr>
At this part of the turorial, we have one Sentinel policy and one Policy Set configured as well as a new file created on our GitHub repository.<br>
We are now ready to run a new 'Queue plan'
<hr>

#### Step 2 - Queue plan to apply your policies

We go to our 'tfc-guide-example' workspace and click on 'Queue plan'.<br>

Upon completion, a new tab 'Policy check' should appear in our UI.<br>

If we have properly configured our Sentinel policy and Policy Set as well as our repository file, Policy check should pass.
