<hr>
<b>Important</b><br>

Deleting a workspace does not destroy infrastructure that has been provisioned by that workspace. <br>

This means that your `AWS DynamoDB` table you provisioned isn't destroyed after destroying the plan and infrastructure on `Terraform Cloud`.<br>

Mitigating the cost of the Infrastructure, especially if you are a `Data Architect` / `Solution Architect` is quite important. <br>

Please bear in mind that running costs may occure if you do not delete the resources provided by your `Terraform` actions.<br>

<hr>

Thus, feel free to go to your `AWS` console and delete the User, Group, DynamoDB table created upon this gist completion.
