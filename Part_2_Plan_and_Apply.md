Once you've complete the Get_Started section of this gist, you are ready to take this part.<br>

In this section, we will provision a `DynamoDB` instance through `Terraform Cloud`.

#### Step 1 - Configure AWS (must have an AWS account)

We will retrieve your `AWS` credentials and set your `Terraform Cloud` variables to use those values.

Log into your `AWS` account, if no account create one: https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start.<br>
You can access your console after Signing Up to AWS using this link: https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home.<br>

Once logged into your `AWS` console, go to `IAM`.<br>
If you are new to AWS, please bypass all user configuration (green ticked marks) for the sake of simplification.<br>

. Next: tags. Use as key: resources and as Value: terraform<br>

. Next: review > create user > download the .csv files which contains security credentials for the user '
terraform_user'<br>

`Access key ID` and a `Secret access key` were provided to you by `AWS`.<br>

Be sure to keep these values in a secure location; you will use them in the next step.<br>

You can keep this window opened and open a new `AWS` console window from your browser.

<b>Important</b>
Follow `AWS` security best practices by deleting this user and the group created after completing this gist, since all security parameters for this user weren't fullfilled for the sake of simplicity.<br>


#### Step 2 - Configure workspace variables
Go back to your `Terraform Cloud` window and click on 'Configure variables'<br>

. Scroll down to `Terraform` variables > Add variables: here you'll create three (3) variables, one related to a user, and two related to the `DynamoDB` database: 'tag_user_name', 'db_write_capacity', 'db_read_capacity'.<br>

. Do the same for Environment variables > Ass variables: create 2 variables 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID' and 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'.

If you get an error, make sure you've followed the prerequisites (Get_Started section of this gist) and that you've set the 5 requested variables correctly.<br>

You can go to your `AWS` console and check that the `DynamoDB` table was provisioned successfully.
